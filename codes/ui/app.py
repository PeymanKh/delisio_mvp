# Description
st.markdown("""
#### About This Project
Welcome to the Delisio MVP, an intelligence solution designed to generate personalized recipes from food images. This project demonstrates:

- Food Recognition: Utilizing a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for accurate dish classification.
- Text Generation: Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for personalized recipe creation.
- Scalable State Management: Powered by LangGraph, enabling efficient, modular, and scalable state machine design.

For the full source code and detailed implementation, visit this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PeymanKh/delisio_mvp).

# Important Note
st.markdown("""
### Important Note:
This MVP version of Delisio is a prototype designed to validate the core concept. Currently, it only supports 10 food categories for recognition, and edge cases may not be handled perfectly. 

#### Supported Food Categories:
- Burger
- Fried Chicken
- Kebab
- Paella
- Pasta
- Pizza
- Ramen
- Steak
- Sushi
- Tacos
